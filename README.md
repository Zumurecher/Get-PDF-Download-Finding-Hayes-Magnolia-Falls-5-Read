Book Descriptions:
A Small Town, Marriage of Convenience, Forced Proximity, Standalone Romance from USA Today and Amazon Bestselling Author, Laura Pavlov.

Sometimes relationships come along that define you.
Someone who brings out sides of you that no one else sees.
The reason that you try to be the best version of yourself.
Savannah Abbott was my North Star growing up.
She was my best friend, my neighbor, and the person who knew me best.
But without warning, she was gone in the blink of an eye.
My life began unraveling the day she left Magnolia Falls.
Because apparently, when you lose the best thing in your life, itâ€™s all downhill from there.
But Iâ€™m a survivorâ€” and I forced myself to move on.
My guard went up, and my ability to trust people disappeared.
Until the day Savannah came back to townâ€”more than a decade later.
And now sheâ€™s acting like Iâ€™m the enemy.
She wants nothing to do with me, even all these years later.
Until she needs a favor.
A temporary husband.
I may not be the marrying type, but for Savannah, Iâ€™m willing to bend the rules.
None of this is real, and she reminds me of that every day while weâ€™re playing house.
I may fight fires for a living, but my new wife is a flame that I donâ€™t want to extinguish.
Sheâ€™s the fire thatâ€™s been missing all along.
